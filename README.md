# Hi there, I'm Adhityan! 👋

## 🚀 About Me

A tech enthusiast with 3+ years of software engineering experience, I architect robust microservices, data pipelines, and AI innovations using Java, Python, and cloud technologies. I thrive on exploring emerging technologies like LangChain and blockchain, constantly building projects that push boundaries and solve real-world problems.

When I'm not crafting code or optimizing databases, you'll find me passionately debating Formula 1 race strategies or improving my tennis backhand.

**Fun fact:** My secret superpower? As an accomplished public speaker and orator, I derive immense satisfaction from helping others find their voice and conquer stage fright, turning nervous presenters into confident communicators.
